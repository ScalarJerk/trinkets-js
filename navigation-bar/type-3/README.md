    1. Why are we styling two separate classes .navbar and .navdiv?
    The .navbar class is commonly used to style the navigation bar, including its background, font, and layout properties. On the other hand, the .navdiv class, which is set to display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;, is likely used to create a flex container for the navigation elements, allowing for easy alignment and spacing of the navigation items.
    By separating the styling of the navigation bar and its container, it provides a clear and modular structure to the CSS, making it easier to maintain and modify the styles for the navigation bar and its containing elements.
